# Flappy Lazarus: A Flappy Bird Clone in Object Pascal

Flappy Lazarus reimagines the classic Flappy Bird gameplay with a meaningful twist. Rather than navigating through endless pipes, players guide their bird to evade bottles. This symbolizes a journey overcoming addiction, offering a layer of narrative depth to the addictive gameplay. Each successfully avoided bottle not only scores points but also represents a personal victory in this metaphorical struggle.

This project is not just a game; it's a showcase of Object Pascal's potential in creating engaging and meaningful gaming experiences. It's designed to be challenging yet rewarding, requiring precision and timing to navigate through the increasingly difficult levels.

## Features:

- **Engaging Gameplay:** Direct your bird through openings between bottles, avoiding contact to keep flying. Each successful navigation scores points, challenging you to beat your high score.
- **Simple Controls:** A single-click mechanism propels the bird upward. Mastering the timing and rhythm is key to success in this game.
- **Generative AI Integration:** Utilizes generative AI to dynamically create backgrounds, enhancing the visual experience without compromising performance.
- **Progress Tracking:** A top bar displays your current score and high score, motivating you to improve with each attempt.
- **Open-Source Project:** Flappy Lazarus is fully open-source, inviting you to delve into its codebase. Whether you're learning Object Pascal, looking to contribute, or simply curious, the project is accessible for all levels of programming expertise.
