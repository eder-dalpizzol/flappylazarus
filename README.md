Flappy Lazarus: A Flappy Bird Clone in Object Pascal
Flappy Lazarus takes the familiar Flappy Bird gameplay and flips it on its head. Instead of avoiding pipes, your bird is on a mission to avoid bottles, symbolizing a struggle against addiction. Navigate your feathered friend through a challenging obstacle course of temptation, collecting points for every bottle successfully dodged.

This project offers a fun and challenging experience while showcasing the capabilities of Object Pascal for game development.​​
